# Solve the following using either while/do while loops
1) Take a number from the user and print sum from 1 to that number 

2) Take a number from the user and print all Odd numbers from 1 to that number 
3) Take a number from the user and print all Even numbers from 1 to that number 
4) Take a number from the user and print fibonacci sequence till that number
	eg : fibonnaci sequence for 5 is 0,1,1,2,3,5
Test cases :
1) input_number = 13 output = 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13
2) input_number = 15 output = 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13
3) input_number = 1 output = 0 1 1 
4) input_number = 0 output = 0 

5) Take a number from the user and print multiplication table from 1 to 10 for that number
6) Take a number from the user and calculate the sum of all even from 1 to that number
